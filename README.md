# Walkthrough_Blog
Idea:
The application would be somewhat similar to the generic blog available on the internet. However, this application would support sign-in feature for the each of user to post their blog entries. Although this blog is designed to be the personal blog, there would be an option given to the user to choose whether publicize their post to the public or not. If it is chosen to be publicized, the entire user would be possible to see that post. 
•	Users are also able to attach photos (with the URL, to avoid setting up the database to store the image files uploaded by users) when they are uploading their posts. 
•	Users also can leave a comment on each of the public post by clicking it and navigate into the detailed post page.


## Description

It consists of a Landing page with trending movies, a search page, detail page and a persistent save title list.
